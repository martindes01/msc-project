\begin{algorithm}

  \label{alg:fingerprint-theory-initialize}
  \input{algorithms/fingerprint/initialize.tex}
\end{algorithm}

The fingerprint initialization operation is presented in \cref{alg:fingerprint-theory-initialize}.
A fingerprint \( f \) is initialized by setting its value to zero, and a base \( \alpha \) is drawn uniformly at random from the integer interval \( \dataintegerinterval{1, p - 1} \).
This is assigned to the primitive routine \( \base (f) \).
It is assumed that the prime number \( p > u - 1 \) has been selected beforehand.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{The fingerprint summary update operation}
  \label{alg:fingerprint-theory-update}
  \input{algorithms/fingerprint/update.tex}
\end{algorithm}

The fingerprint update operation is presented in \cref{alg:fingerprint-theory-update}.
This operation updates a fingerprint \( f \) so as to include in its representation of the underlying multiset an increase in the multiplicity of an item \( x \) by weight \( w \).
The value of the updated fingerprint \( f' \) is given by \cref{eq:fingerprint-theory-update}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fingerprint-theory-update}
  f' = \left( f + w \cdot \alpha^{x} \right) \bmod p.
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{The fingerprint summary merge operation}
  \label{alg:fingerprint-theory-merge}
  \input{algorithms/fingerprint/merge.tex}
\end{algorithm}

Two fingerprints can be merged into one.
This operation allows the fingerprint of a stream to be computed in parallel, i.e.\@ fingerprints of distinct portions of a stream can be computed concurrently and eventually combined in order to obtain the fingerprint of the stream as a whole.
The fingerprint merge operation is presented in \cref{alg:fingerprint-theory-merge}.
Merging two fingerprints \( a \) and \( b \) into a single fingerprint \( f \) is a simple case of addition modulo \( p \), as formalized in \cref{eq:fingerprint-theory-merge}, but this will only work if the two fingerprints are computed using the same base.
This should come as no surprise, since it is a generalization of the update operation; an update is the special case of the merger of one fingerprint \( a = f \), whose base is \( \alpha \), and another fingerprint \( b = w \cdot \alpha^{x} \), whose base is also \( \alpha \)---the only difference being that in the case of an update, the fingerprint \( b \) represents a multiset whose underlying set has a cardinality of one.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fingerprint-theory-merge}
  f = \left( a + b \right) \bmod p.
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{The fingerprint summary query operation}
  \label{alg:fingerprint-theory-query}
  \input{algorithms/fingerprint/query.tex}
\end{algorithm}

For the sake of completeness, the fingerprint query operation is presented in \cref{alg:fingerprint-theory-query}.
This operation simply returns the value of the fingerprint.
To approximate whether two fingerprints represent the same multiset, their values can be compared for equality, but this will only work if the two fingerprints are computed using the same base.
If the fingerprints differ, the multisets they represent must also differ.
Additionally, if the multisets are equal, their fingerprints must also be equal.
This is formalized in \cref{eq:fingerprint-theory-unequal-implication,eq:fingerprint-theory-equal-implication}.
Note that if the fingerprints are equal, it is not necessarily the case that the multisets are equal, although for sufficiently large values of \( p \), it is highly likely that they are (see \cref{subsec:fingerprint-analysis-accuracy}).

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:fingerprint-theory-unequal-implication}
  a \neq b \implies S_{a} \neq S_{b}. \\
  \label{eq:fingerprint-theory-equal-implication}
  a = b \impliedby S_{a} = S_{b}.
\end{align}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{The fingerprint summary equality operation}
  \label{alg:fingerprint-theory-equal}
  \input{algorithms/fingerprint/equal.tex}
\end{algorithm}

A fingerprint equality operation can be defined for this comparison, as presented in \cref{alg:fingerprint-theory-equal}.
This operation simply returns \True{} if the two fingerprints are equal, and \False{} otherwise.
It is assumed that the fingerprints share the same base.
